Module 3 challenge

We first evaluate the cvs files for PyBank

In this code, we make use of the csv files in our possession to evaluate the following criteria:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

We then proceed to use the csv for PyPoll to evaluate the next set of criteria and print the results onto a text file

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote
